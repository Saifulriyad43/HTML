<h3 style="font-family:arial;color:neon;font-size:15px;border:1px solid red;">
I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one.
 One was highly educated and intelligent.
 He had a Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate work in less than two years.
 He then went on to Stanford University,
 the University of Chicago,
 and Northwestern University to do his advanced studies,
 all on full financial scholarships.
 The other father never finished the eighth grade.
 Both men were successful in their careers,
 working hard all their lives. Both earned substantial incomes.
 Yet one always struggled financially.
 The other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii.
 One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family,
 charities, and his church. The other left bills to be paid.
 Both men were strong, charismatic, and influential.
 Both men offered me advice,
 but they did not advise the same things.
 Both men believed strongly in education but did not recommend the same course of study.
